Significant accounting policies These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. a Principles of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary St. Barbera Resources Limited. b Mining properties and deferred exploration expenditures The Company records its mining properties at cost less amounts written down and capitalizes exploration expenditures until such time as they are depleted against production from the property to which they apply. If exploration is deemed unsuccessful if the mineral properties are abandoned or if other developments which negate development occur the applicable costs are written off. c Translation of foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Other assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the historical rate of exchange. Operations are translated into Canadian dollars at the average rate of exchange during the year. 2. Nature of operations and basis of presentation The Company its subsidiary and its associated companies are engaged in the exploration development and production of resource properties. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The application of the going concern concept is dependent on the Company's ability to generate profitable future operations and its ability to obtain sufficient working capital from external financing or the sale of assets to meet the Company's liabilities as they become payable. 3.

CONIAGAS RESOURCES LIMITED MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT DECEMBER 31 2005 Date April 10 2006 GENERAL The following discussion of performance financial condition and future prospects should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Coniagas Resources Limited Coniagas or the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31 2005 and 2004 the 2005 Financial Statements and Notes thereto as well as its direct and indirect whollyowned subsidiary St. Barbera Resources which have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. This discussion covers the most recently completed financial year of Coniagas and the subsequent period up to the date of the filing of this managements discussion and analysis MDA. All dollar amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Readers are encouraged to read the Companys public information filings on Sedar at The Company's public filings can be accessed and viewed through the Company's website A link to the Company's Canadian Securities Commissions filings can be viewed via the System for Electronic Data Analysis and Retrieval SEDAR at DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Coniagas is a Canadabased resource company whose focus is to explore and develop mineral deposits throughout the world. These activities are presently conducted in Canada either directly or through subsidiaries or in conjunction with other participants. In addition Coniagas invests in other corporations that engage in similar or related activities. Since 1904 when Coniagas grew out of the Cobalt silver camp its objective has been the finding and developing of producing mines. The production of silver in Cobalt led to financing of Pamour Coniaurum gold mines and later the next cycle of activities which included interests in Quebec Sturgeon River Gold Mines Bachelor Lake Gold Mines and St Andrew Goldfields. We continue to examine the merits of prospects that could lead to future production. Other property assets of the Company include a 40 equity ownership in a joint venture to explore certain mineral claims in Garrison Michaud and Guibord townships in Ontario with St Andrew Goldfields Limited and Kinross Gold Corporation. The Company has undertaken an exploration drilling program on the Garrison Creek Property. During 2005 five holes were drilled in 2005 totaling 2057 meters on the Garrison Creek Claim Block A summary of the drilling follows • GC0508 Drilled near the south property boundary across a package of sedimentary rocks displaying weak alteration and mineralization. Overburden depth was excessive at 122 meters down hole. A mixed zone of porphyry calcite veining and sedimentary material occurs between 294.5 m. and 359.9. Anomalous in gold to cash of 123187 at the end of December 31 2004. Most of the Companys requirements for capital to maintain its ownership level in its properties as well as pay for exploration expenditures and administrative expenses have been met through the completion of private placements. The Company will have to rely on further equity financings in order to maintain an adequate liquidity base with which to support its general operations and exploration and development mandate. The mineral exploration business is risky and most exploration projects will not become mines. The Company may offer other mining companies the opportunity to acquire interests in any of its properties in return for funding by such companies of all or part of the exploration and development of such properties. For the funding of any property acquisitions or exploration conducted by the Company the Company depends on the issue of shares from treasury to investors. Such financing will depend in turn on various factors such as a positive mineral exploration climate positive stock market conditions a companys track record and the experience of management. If such financing is unable for any reason the Company may become unable to retain its mineral interests and carry out its business plan. The Companys exploration operations are subject to government legislation policies and controls relating to prospecting development production environmental protection mining taxes and labour standards. In addition the profitability of any prospect is directed by the market for minerals which is influenced by many factors including changing production costs supply and demand inflation and the political environment. The Companys success is also dependent on the knowledge and expertise of its management and employees and their ability to identify and advance attractive exploration projects and targets. The competition for highly qualified personnel is strong and there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to retain or attract such personnel. Other than as discussed herein the Company is not aware of any trends demands commitments events or uncertainties that may result in the Companys liquidity or capital resources either materially increasing or decreasing at present or in the foreseeable future. Material increases or decreases in the Companys liquidity and capital resources will be substantially determined by the success or failure of the Companys exploration programs on its mineral properties and its ability to obtain equity financing. The value of the major portion of the assets of the Company may only be realized over time due to the low demand for such assets. These assets include mining properties and deferred exploration expenses. Investments have a net market value in excess of carrying value but this market value does not necessarily represent the realizable value of the holdings which may be more or less than indicated by the quoted market values due to the relatively low trading volumes in these securities. OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no material offbalance sheet arrangements no material capital lease agreements and no longterm debt obligation. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS It is management opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate currency or credit risks arising from it financial instruments. The fair value of its financial instruments approximates the carrying amount. Virtually all the companys cash is held at one financial institution. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada.

ROBERT HAMBLEY Chartered Accountant 151 Bloor Street West Suite 800 Toronto Ontario M5S 1S4 Auditor's Report To the Shareholders Of Coniagas Resources Limited I have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Coniagas Resources Limited as at December 31 2005 and the consolidated statements of operations and deficit and cash flow for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that I plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. In my opinion these consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company as at December 31 2005 and the results of its operations and the changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
